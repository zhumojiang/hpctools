Explanation: 

**The current main version is V4.0: Parallelization with OpenMP and hotspot analysis tools.**
 

Versions V3.0: Auto-vectorization and improvements using Intel Advisor, V2.0: Benchmarking with GCC and ICX, and V1.0: Use Valgrind Memcheck to check the serial implementation can be found in their respective releases.

The execution commands I use all have unique names: dgesv.c and main.c. For different versions of the code used during the process, such as dgesv-optimal1.c and main-icx.c, please rename them to dgesv.c and main.c
when testing. At the same time, rename the original dgesv.c and main.c to different names and restore them after testing is completed.
