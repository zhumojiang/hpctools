Explanation: The code can be found under each release. The execution commands I use all have unique
names: dgesv.c and main.c. For different versions of the code used during the process, such as dgesv-optimal1.c and main-icx.c, please rename them to dgesv.c and main.c
when testing. At the same time, rename the original dgesv.c and main.c to different
names and restore them after testing is completed.
